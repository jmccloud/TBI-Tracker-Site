						<dt id="description">What is TBI Tracker?</dt>
						<dd>
							TBI Tracker is a patient-centric, simple, safe, mobile health data manager that 
							provides patients and their families with their complete health information 
							in the palm of their hand.  It leverages the
							<a href="http://www.projecthdata.org">hData</a> and
							<a href="https://github.com/project-rhex/patient-data-server">RHEx</a> projects, 
							and provides an applet framework to provide hyper-personalized 
							“focused-on-me” applets to engage patients in their own health status and 
							how they can improve.  TBI Tracker will be released to the open source community 
							and available for free.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="need">Why do we need TBI Tracker?</dt>
						<dd>
							Today, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for patients and families
							to obtain their complete health information.  Patients and families 
							often see many different providers and specialists and that data is owned 
							and scattered across those providers.  Many patients today have little or no 
							access to this health care data.  When it is made available to the patient, 
							it is spread across a variety of portals and often difficult to understand.  
							Patient-provider communication is also very sporadic and inconsistent.  All 
							of these factors makes it very difficult to engage patients to improve their 
							health, which results in increased office visits and higher cost.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="objective">What is the objective of TBI Tracker?</dt>
						<dd>
							The desired outcome for TBI Tracker is to securely collect and capture the 
							patient’s entire health care record to make it easy for them to understand 
							and correct, if necessary.  By helping patients understand their individual 
							health data and their family’s health status, and by providing a mobile 
							platform to access that data, TBI Tracker seeks to improve the communication 
							between patients, family members, and health care providers.  This should 
							engage and empower patients to improve their health access protocols, 
							security, and vision, with better results at a lower cost.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="users">Who are the intended users of TBI Tracker?</dt>
						<dd>
							Patients and families.
						</dd>
						<dt id="funding">Who is funding the TBI Tracker project?</dt>
						<dd>
							The TBI Tracker project is currently being funded by 
							<a href="http://www.mitre.org">the MITRE corporation</a>.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="meaningful_use">Can TBI Tracker be used to demonstrate Meaningful Use?</dt>
						<dd>
							Stage 2 Meaningful Requirements mandates that information on allergies,
							adverse reactions, alerts, medications, problems, procedures, and results
							be reported.  TBI Tracker provides this information in the summary, conditions, 
							and timeline pages.  TBI Tracker also provides information that is optional in
							Stage 2, including encounters, functional status, immunizations, plan of
							care, and vital signs.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="human_factors">Does TBI Tracker have human factors specialists on the team?</dt>
						<dd>
							Yes, TBI Tracker has human factors specialists on the team. Human factors 
							is a multidisciplinary field that concerns the study of how people 
							interact with technological systems. Human factors practitioners consider 
							the physical settings, cognitive and perceptual capabilities of the user, 
							the organizational climate and how these factors interact with technology. 
							The primary goal is to understand the user and develop technology that 
							enhances what people do well and provide support for those tasks that 
							people find difficult. Human factors has important implications for health 
							care systems, so human factors experts apply their knowledge of human 
							computer interaction, usability, and user interface design to improve the 
							usability of the TBI Tracker software.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="operations">What is the basic theory of operations for use of TBI Tracker?</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>
								TBI Tracker works in conjunction with the RESTful Health Exchange project (RHEx)
								Patient Data Server to provide patients with their data.  RHEx interfaces 
								with a variety of different EHR systems and acts as a secure repository 
								for patient data.  RHEx also provides a single RESTful API, which TBI Tracker 
								uses to access the data.
							</p>
							<img src="images/rhex.png" />
							<p class="after-rhex">
								Once the patient's data is downloaded to TBI Tracker in greenCDA JSON format, 
								it is encrypted (if the pass code has been set) and stored on the iPad so 
								that it can be accessed even without a network connection.  Local iPad
								storage allows the patient to control their own data, bring it to
								their provider, and ask more informed questions about their health.
							</p>
							<p>
								If a network connection is available, real-time updates are possible
								between RHEx and TBI Tracker.
							</p>
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="standards">What standards does TBI Tracker use?</dt>
						<dd>
							TBI Tracker make use of several emerging standards, both directly and 
							indirectly, including
							<a href="http://projecthdata.org">hData</a>
							and the
							<a href="https://github.com/project-rhex/patient-data-server">RHEx Patient Data Server</a>.  
							Soon, it will also integrate with standards established by the
							<a href="http://projectpophealth.org">popHealth</a> project.
							<a class="top" href="#top">Back to top</a>
						</dd>
						<dt id="instructions">Are there step-by-step instructions for setting up TBI Tracker from source code?</dt>
						<dd>
							Yes.  This information will be made available when the code is released.
